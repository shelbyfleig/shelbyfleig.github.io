      <p class="introduction">S</p><p>ometime between preparing for a parole hearing, organizing an independent feminist prison newsletter, publishing essays on solitary confinement and answering calls at the Illinois domestic violence hotline, Monica Cosby needs to make a grocery run.
      </p>
      <p>The aisles of seemingly identical brands are overwhelming. Like using a smartphone, it’s something she hasn’t adjusted to since being released from a women’s prison in December 2015, after serving half of a 40-year sentence.
      </p>
      <p>Cosby is reclaiming her lifelong activist roots as she grows into the local prison reform and abolishment movement. Until a couple months before the former lawyer’s release, she had no idea conversations around prison reform happened at all. Speaking at a University of Illinois-Chicago panel called “Building Abolition: Inside/Outside Prison Justice Movements” Thursday, Cosby said her life has been marked by the same cycle of domestic and sexual violence that propels many women into the prison system.

      <p>According to a 2016 report by the Vera Institute of Justice, 86 percent of incarcerated women report having experienced sexual violence in their lifetimes. Solitary was used as punishment, Cosby said, for refusing to sleep with correctional officers. In acts of resistance to abusive COs, she and others took no steps to hide their relationships in prison.

          People approach prison reform the same way they approach animal rights or environmentalism, as if prisoners don’t have the ability to speak for themselves the way animals and the Earth don’t.
      </p>

      <p>“We could have love that was legitimate and intense – maybe even more intense given the restrictions,” she said. “We do that because we need to live. We need to live as fully as we can. We chose to be alive, even there.”
      </p>
      <p>Released to a halfway house initially, Cosby struggled to align with the faith-based policies. She compared her time there to being in an abusive relationship. At last week’s panel, she called for more resources to be made available without strings attached, like religion.
      </p>
      <p>Also on the panel was Rev. Jason Lydon, founder and former national director of Black and Pink, a community of LGBTQ and HIV-positive prisoners. He said people should take Cosby and other former inmates seriously when they call for reform.
      </p>
      <p>“People approach prison reform the same way they approach animal rights or environmentalism, as if prisoners don’t have the ability to speak for themselves the way animals and the Earth don’t,” he said.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote-extend"><p>
      Exactly,” Cosby said. “Don’t put a muzzle on me.
      </p></blockquote>
      <p>Cosby grew up volunteering at the Uptown People’s Law Center and went on to become a jailhouse lawyer who worked disability and Social Security cases for former coal miners. From 1995 to 2015, UPLC director Alan Mills was the only consistent contact she had to the outside world besides the constant stream of Fox News. Mills visited Cosby once a year, called occasionally to talk and regularly sent Cosby sci-fi and fantasy novels and other readings.
      </p>
      <p>While incarcerated, Cosby was part of a theatre troupe Acting Out Theatre and wrote poetry to cope. One poem, finished in 2000, recognized the women in her life.
      </p>
      <p class="poem">"...To all those women with & for whom I have wept<br>
        shared such ecstatic love with, in whose arms I have slept<br>
        with whom I laughed...<br>
        with whom I danced...<br>
        built sandcastles on the lakeshore...<br>
        picked flowers & baked cookies for...<br>
        we dreamed our dreams as children, young, wild & free...<br>
        we planned the lives we wanted to lead...”<br>
      </p>
      <p>Cosby said real solidarity goes beyond talking about reform. The 49-year-old is brainstorming how to fund a feminist newsletter she plans to start mailing to prisons in January, after the parole hearing marking the end of her second year free.
      </p>
      <p>Cosby said she wants to be the source of hope that she didn’t have for so long, so she’s writing for women, for inmates – uncensored.
